{"body":"The Computer Time Tracker program tracks time spent on the computer (not individual programs), so the user can track their daily work time.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://peruukki.github.com/ComputerTimeTracker/images/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\nThe program tracks user session events (logon, lock, unlock) and divides computer usage to periods between such events. The user can exclude certain periods from the calculated work time.\r\n\r\nThe program should be running whenever the user is logged on, so it should be launched at logon by adding it in the Startup folder. When running, it is visible on the notification area. The program recognizes when it is started for the first time on a day and starts calculating computer usage time from then on.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
